# EatIn
- Peer-To-Peer food delivery app. <br/>
- the app is meant for people to be able to buy and sell their home cooking dishes. <br/>
- currently there is no real payment system.<br/>
- use requirement.txt for dependencies. <br/>
- cart items - each item added to the cart will receive an id. when a cart item is added to the db it will also receive a NULL value as an order_id. once the user (eater) will proceed to checkout the NULL value will be overridden and all cart items belong to the same cart will receive the same (numeric) order_id. <br/>
